  <section id="lectures">
    <h3 class="left-border">Lectures</h3>
    <p>
      Lectures are Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 10:30-11:20 in 420-040.
      <a href="lectures.html">Lecture notes</a> are
      available in advance and provide an outline for much of the
      material that will be presented in class. I recommend that you print
      out the notes and bring them to class so you can mark them up with
      additional notes during lecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recommend against using laptop computers during class. Although
      some people prefer taking notes on a laptop instead of by hand,
      educational studies have shown that students using laptops
      tend to learn less effectively than those without laptops: there
      are too many distractions available on an open computer.
    </p>

  <section id="materials">
    <h3 class="left-border">Additional Materials</h3>
    <p>
      There is no required textbook for this class, and I am not aware of
      a book that is a perfect match to the lecture material. The content of
      the course is defined by the lectures. You will need additional reference
      material to complete the programming projects, but this material is
      available on the Web. One good online source for reference documentation
      on HTML, CSS, and the DOM is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">
      Mozilla Developer Network</a>.
      A comprehensive book is
      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-HTML-Definitive-Danny-Goodman/dp/0596527403/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1251152927&amp;sr=1-1">
      Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Reference, Third Edition</a>, by Danny Goodman
      (O'Reilly Media), but this describes the Web as of a few years ago, so it
      doesn't include newer features such as HTML5. It is freely available to Stanford students
      via <a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari Books Online</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web application we build in the course's projects will use what is
      known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)">MEAN stack</a>.
      The MEAN stack uses the JavaScript language in both the browser and the server-side.
      The lectures will provide an introduction to JavaScript, but more complete information can be
      found on the web and in some books freely available to Stanford students through
      <a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari Books Online</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>
      by Douglas Crockford (O'Reilly Media). As the book's title suggests, JavaScript is not a simple
      language and it is easy to hurt yourself with some of its features. This book recommends a somewhat
      more safe subset of the language to use.</li>
      <li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596806767.do">JavaScript Patterns</a> by
      Stoyan Stefanov (O'Reilly Media). JavaScript programmers have discovered ways around issues
      in the language by doing things in certain ways (i.e. patterns). These patterns are commonly
      used in JavaScript programs but some of them use strange features of the language
      so it is not clear what is going on if you don't recognize them as a common pattern.</li>

      <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805531.do">JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 6th Edition</a>
      by David Flanagan (O'Reilly Media). As the title suggests this is a comprehensive description of JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The class project assignments, lectures and sections will cover what you need to know about the
      MEAN stack. For additional material recommend starting at the web sites of the different
      components:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose.js</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> </li>

  <section id="prerequisites">
    <h3 class="left-border">Prerequisites</h3> 
    <p>
      The official prerequisites for this class on ExploreCourses are CS107 and CS108.
      These are listed as the prerequisites because we expect a certain level of engineering maturity
      and experience. You should be comfortable working with the command line, picking up a new language
      and framework, reading technical documentation, and debugging your code. Students who have taken this
      class directly after 106B/X have had to work harder and spend more time than their peers, but it's not impossible. If you have any questions about whether you should take this class, please feel free to 
      contact the staff.
    </p> 
  </section> 

  <section id="sections">
    <h3 class="left-border">Discussion Sections</h3>
    <p>
      The class will have three weekly discussion sections led by the
      course assistants (times TBA). The sections will supplement lecture content
      with additional examples as well as cover material needed for
      the projects. Attendance is not mandatory but we <strong>highly encourage</strong> 
      you to attend any or all of them.
    </p> 
    <p>
      The sections will meet on the Friday, Monday, and Tuesday
      immediately preceding each project deadline (e.g. the Monday and Tuesday
      sections will not meet during the first week). All of the sections for each project   
      will cover the same material.
    </p> 
  </section>

  <section id="projects">
    <h3 class="left-border">Projects</h3> 
    <p>
      The class will include 8 <a href="projects.html">projects</a>,
      one due each week except the first week. Projects will be due at the 
      same time each week, <strong>on Thursdays at 11:59 PM</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We encourage you to discuss the projects with other students; both
      giving and receiving advice will help you to learn. It's fine to
      discuss overall strategy, share tips about Web technologies (useful
      CSS styles, library methods, etc.), and give and receive debugging
      assistance. However, <strong>you must write your own code</strong>. It's not OK
      to share code or write code collaboratively. The projects are intended
      to be simple enough for each person to implement all of every project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please do not post your project solutions on the Web, either during or
      after the class. Students occasionally do this because they are proud of
      their class work (some of the work in this class is quite good!), but
      this makes it easy for future students to copy your work rather than
      figuring things out for themselves. Posting solutions on the Web is a
      Stanford Honor Code violation, since it it has the effect of giving
      improper assistance to other students.
    </p>
    <p>Style points: most of the grade for each project is
      based on the functionality of your project (does it do what
      the problem asks?). However, for each project there are also a
      few extra <i>style points</i>, which are awarded based on
      the <i>way</i> you solve the problem, not how your solution
      behaves. These reflect the importance of things such as proper
      HTML validation, clean code structure, and nice-looking interfaces.
      The style points to be awarded for each project are described
      near the end of each project description.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="late-days">
    <h3 class="left-border">Late Days</h3> 
    <p class="text-danger">//to be updated</p>
    <p>
      Each student is allowed a total of 3 late days,
      which may be spent in units of one day (24 hours) on any projects
      throughout the quarter. Late days are intended to cover special
      situations such as illness and family emergencies, so use them wisely.
      Once your late days have been used up,
      late work will not receive any credit.
    </p> 
  </section>

  <section id="browsers">
    <h3 class="left-border">Browsers</h3>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, Web browsers are still not 100% identical in their behavior,
      so Web pages may behave differently on different browsers. For this class,
      the reference browser is Chrome: <strong>your project solutions must work on
      Chrome, and the CAs will use Chrome to test them</strong>. Your solutions need
      not work on any browser other than Chrome. You may use a different
      browser to develop your solutions if you wish (Chrome, Firefox, and
      Safari all have very similar behavior), but please test on Chrome
      before submitting. We do not recommend that you use Internet
      Explorer for development: historically, its behavior has been quite
      different from the other browsers, so things that work on IE may
      not work on Chrome, and vice versa.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="exams">
    <h3 class="left-border">Exams</h3>
    <p>
      The class will have a midterm exam and as well as a
      final examination during exams week. If you have a conflict with the scheduled
      time for either examination, contact the staff to arrange an alternate time.
      You may bring two double-sided 8.5x11" pages of notes with you to the midterm and
      the final exam; other than that, exams are closed-book.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="regrades">
    <h3 class="left-border">Regrades</h3>
    <p class="text-danger">//to be updated</p>
    <p>
      We sometimes make mistakes in grading, both on projects and exams, and are
      happy to correct these if you point out the error. To request a regrade
      for a project,
      send an email with the subject starting with the string "REGRADE HW"
      (e.g. "REGRADE HW1" for a regrade request on Project #1)
      to the course instructor and we will respond as quickly as possible.
      Regrade requests must be submitted within 5 days after we send out the grades
      for a project or exam.
    </p>
    <p>
      For regrade requests related to the midterm exam, take your exam to the
      office hours of the person who graded the particular question. For regrade
      requests related to the final exam, take a picture of the answer in question,
      and include it in an email to the instructor with a subject of "REGRADE FINAL".
      Exam regrade requests must be submitted
      within 5 days after we make the graded exams available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regrade requests should focus on errors (i.e., something we thought was
      wrong but actually was right, or you believe we misunderstood your work).
      There may be situations where you agree you made an error but disagree
      about the number of points deducted; unfortunately, we cannot
      change your score in these situations, because it would require
      a change in the grading rubric and thus require us to regrade all
      of the projects or exams.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="grading">
    <h3 class="left-border">Grading Policy</h3> 
    <p>
      Grades for the class will be determined as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Projects: 55%</li> 
      <li>Midterm: 15%</li> 
      <li>Final: 30%</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="documented-disabilities">
    <h3 class="left-border">Students with Documented Disabilities</h3>
    <p>
      Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a
      disability must initiate the request with the Student Disability Resource
      Center (SDRC) located within the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). SDRC
      staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend
      reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for
      faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is being made.
      Students should contact the SDRC as soon as possible since timely notice
      is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at
      563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066).

  <h1>Submitting Class Assignments</h1>
  <h3 class="left-border">Cleaning up before submitting</h3>
  <p>
    Please delete any unnecessary files from your directory before submitting.
    After cleaning up, it's a good idea to run a quick check just to make
    sure that your application still works.
  </p>
  <h3 class="left-border">Submitting</h3>
  <p>
    Use an SSH client to connect to a
    <a href="https://uit.stanford.edu/service/sharedcomputing" target="_blank">FarmShare</a> machine
    (e.g. cardinal.stanford.edu, myth.stanford.edu, corn.stanford.edu).
    Upload your files to some directory in your AFS space (i.e. your home directory). You should use
    a separate directory for each project.
    The submit script sends all files in the current directory.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you haven't uploaded files to a FarmShare machine before, you may
    want to install one of several programs to help with this. If your
    laptop runs MacOS, we recommend 
    <a href="https://uit.stanford.edu/service/ess/mac/fetch" target="_blank">Fetch</a>, Filezilla or scp.  
    If your laptop runs Windows, we recommend <a href="https://uit.stanford.edu/service/ess/pc/securefx" target="_blank">SecureFX</a> or WinSCP.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note: For projects 4 and later, you will need to submit your <em>entire</em> working directory because
    there are hidden files used to run your project. Do not manually upload individual files. 
    We highly recommend taking the time during projects 1 to 3 to get used to uploading entire directories to your AFS space. Please contact the staff if you need assistance with this.</strong>
  <p>
  In addition to including any deliverables required by the project
  instructions, you should include a file called <code>ID</code> 
  that includes your SUID, your leland username, and
  your full name (last-name-comma-first-name). For example:
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <pre>052340342 gluu Luu, Gary</pre>
  </div>

  <p>
  From your project directory, type "/usr/class/cs142/bin/submit" and 
  answer the prompts.
  When prompted "Which assignment are you submitting?" enter the project
  number, e.g. <code>1</code> for Project 1. 
  </p>

  <p>
    You may submit multiple times. Your last submission is the one we'll
    count, as well as any late days used for that last submission.
    Note: if you are planning to use late days for an assignment, and you
    have already submitted before the due date, please make sure your
    most recent submission contains a file <code>late</code>, which should
    contain a note stating that you will be using late days for this
    assignment. Otherwise we may grade the assignment you have already
    submitted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is an example submission of project 1 (all projects for
    this class are individual, so you should always answer "n" to
    the question about working with a partner):
  </p>

  <div>
    <pre>corn22:~/project1> /usr/class/cs142/bin/submit

The script is used for electronic submissions for CS142.
[If you're having trouble, try running it on the corns.]

  <h3 class="left-border">Checking your submission</h3>
  <p>
    Once you have gone through the submission process, you can check to make
    sure your submission was received. To do this, enter a command like
    the following on the machine where you submitted your assignment:
  </p>
  <div>
    <pre>ls -l /usr/class/cs142/submissions/<i>number</i>/$USER-*</pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    (Replace <code><i>number</i></code> with the assignment number). This
    will list all of the
    files that you submitted. You should be able to examine the individual files
    as well, if you wish. This mechanism should only allow you to view your own
    submissions; if for some reason you discover you can see submissions from
    other students, please let us know, since it means we have misconfigured
    the class site!
